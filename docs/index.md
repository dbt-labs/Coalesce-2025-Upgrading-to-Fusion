# âš¡ dbt Fusion Upgrade Training

Welcome to the **Coalesce 2025 dbt Fusion Upgrade Training**! This training repository provides hands-on experience upgrading from **dbt Core to dbt Fusion**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Training Objectives

Practice upgrading a real dbt Core project to dbt Fusion while resolving both **hard blockers** (compilation/runtime issues) and **soft blockers** (best practices and optimization opportunities).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Training Branch

Create a new branch using this naming convention:
```bash
git checkout -b firstname_lastname_fusion_migration
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

1. **Update credentials**: Modify `profiles.yml` and/or `dbt_project.yml` to use your Snowflake ZNA credentials
2. **Seed the data**: Run `dbt seed` in dbt Core first to create the underlying data sources
3. **Begin migration**: Use the migration helper in VS Code:
   ```bash
   dbtf init --fusion-upgrade
   ```

### 3. Work Through Blockers

- **ðŸ”´ Hard blockers**: Must be fixed before Fusion will compile/run
  - Deprecated configurations
  - Broken macros
  - Incompatible syntax
  
- **ðŸŸ¡ Soft blockers**: Warnings and best practice improvements
  - Model naming conventions
  - Semantic configurations
  - Performance optimizations

### 4. Submit Your Work

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Open a pull request for review
3. Share your migration approach with the group
